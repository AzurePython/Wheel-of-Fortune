# Wheel-of-Fortune

This repository contains all of the files needed to play a python version of the wheel of fortune game. In order to play, you must first download all of the text files and then run the entire block of code contained in the python file. Make sure that you save the text files in the same directory as the python file, or change the reading functions to access the correct file location. You can also check out my psuedocode to see how I planned out the programming for this project.
